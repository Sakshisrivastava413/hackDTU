## SMART ATTENDENCE 
***
***
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
First of all its a great honour for us to be a part of HackDTU 2.0. Our team has thought and worked upon the theme of "Industrial Intenet" and we are really proud to present our final product "Smart Attendance" which has been rigrously developed by team AGU.
***
So, as of now we have developed a backend in django which gives a JSON response after taking two fields as input like target file name and source file name to be compared the faces from, using the AWS API. We tested the API with many test cases (including actual use cases like a more than 20 people group to find a single person) and found it to be successful in more than 90% cases.
